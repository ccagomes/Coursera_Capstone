A few minutes driving from one neighborhood to another is enough to show considerable differences in real estate investing. So what aspects affect the price of a property? How can we determine this?\n\nWe will explore in this project the neighborhoods of New York to understand which factors are most determining in the price of a property, as well as whether it is possible to use nearby property prices to estimate the value of another property.",
